# Understanding Threats and Vulnerabilities

## Introduction

In the realm of cybersecurity, understanding the landscape of threats and vulnerabilities is paramount to safeguarding sensitive data and systems. Below, we delve into the concepts of cyber threats and vulnerabilities:

## Cyber Threats

Cyber threats encompass incidents or situations that could negatively impact your network or data management systems, from phishing attacks to data breaches and natural disasters disrupting data access.

## Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities represent weaknesses within a system that enable cyber threats to exploit and compromise security, including software flaws like SQL injections and insecure practices such as transmitting sensitive data in non-encrypted formats. Identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities is essential for fortifying defenses against potential cyber attacks.
