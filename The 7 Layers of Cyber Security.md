## The 7 layers of cyber security should center on the mission critical assets you are seeking to protect.

1. **Mission Critical Assets**  
   This is the data you need to protect.

2. **Data Security**  
   Data security controls protect the storage and transfer of data.

3. **Application Security**  
   Application security controls protect access to an application, an application’s access to your mission critical assets, and the internal security of the application.

4. **Endpoint Security**  
   Endpoint security controls protect the connection between devices and the network.

5. **Network Security** 
   Network security controls protect an organization’s network and prevent unauthorized access to the network.

6. **Perimeter Security**  
   Perimeter security controls include both the physical and digital security methodologies that protect the business overall.

7. **The Human Layer**  
   Humans are the weakest link in any cyber security posture. Human security controls include phishing simulations and access management controls that protect mission critical assets from a wide variety of human threats, including cyber criminals, malicious insiders, and negligent users.
