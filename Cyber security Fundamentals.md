# Cybersecurity Fundamentals

## Confidentiality

Confidentiality is about preventing the disclosure of data to unauthorized parties. It also means trying to keep the identity of authorized parties involved in sharing and holding data private and anonymous. Often, confidentiality is compromised by cracking poorly encrypted data, Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, and disclosing sensitive data. Standard measures to establish confidentiality include:

- Data encryption
- Two-factor authentication
- Biometric verification
- Security tokens

## Integrity

Integrity refers to protecting information from being modified by unauthorized parties. Standard measures to guarantee integrity include:

- Cryptographic checksums
- Using file permissions
- Uninterrupted power supplies
- Data backups

## Availability

Availability ensures that authorized parties can access the information when needed. Standard measures to guarantee availability include:

- Backing up data to external drives
- Implementing firewalls
- Having backup power supplies
- Data redundancy
