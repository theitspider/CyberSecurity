# Types of Cyber Attacks

A cyber-attack is an exploitation of computer systems and networks. It uses malicious code to alter computer code, logic, or data and leads to cybercrimes, such as information and identity theft.

Cyber-attacks can be classified into the following categories:

1. **Web-based attacks**
2. **System-based attacks**

## Web-based attacks

These are the attacks which occur on a website or web applications. Some of the important web-based attacks are as follows:

### 1. Injection attacks

It is the attack in which some data is injected into a web application to manipulate the application and fetch the required information.  
**Examples**: SQL Injection, Code Injection, Log Injection, XML Injection, etc.

### 2. DNS Spoofing

DNS Spoofing is a type of computer security hacking where data is introduced into a DNS resolver's cache, causing the name server to return an incorrect IP address. This diverts traffic to the attacker's computer or any other computer. DNS spoofing attacks can go on for a long period of time without being detected and can cause serious security issues.

### 3. Session Hijacking

It is a security attack on a user session over a protected network. Web applications create cookies to store the state and user sessions. By stealing the cookies, an attacker can have access to all of the user data.

### 4. Phishing

Phishing is a type of attack that attempts to steal sensitive information like user login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker masquerades as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication.

### 5. Brute Force

It is a type of attack that uses a trial and error method. This attack generates a large number of guesses and validates them to obtain actual data like user passwords and personal identification numbers. This attack may be used by criminals to crack encrypted data, or by security analysts to test an organization's network security.

### 6. Denial of Service (DoS)

It is an attack meant to make a server or network resource unavailable to users. It accomplishes this by flooding the target with traffic or sending it information that triggers a crash. It uses a single system and a single internet connection to attack a server. It can be classified into the following:

- **Volume-based attacks**: Its goal is to saturate the bandwidth of the attacked site and is measured in bits per second.
- **Protocol attacks**: It consumes actual server resources and is measured in packets per second.
- **Application layer attacks**: Its goal is to crash the web server and is measured in requests per second.

### 7. Dictionary attacks

This type of attack stores a list of commonly used passwords and validates them to obtain the original password.

### 8. URL Interpretation

It is a type of attack where certain parts of a URL are changed to make a web server deliver web pages for which the attacker is not authorized to browse.

### 9. File Inclusion attacks

It is a type of attack that allows an attacker to access unauthorized or essential files available on the web server or to execute malicious files on the web server by making use of the include functionality.

### 10. Man-in-the-Middle attacks

It is a type of attack that allows an attacker to intercept the connection between a client and server and act as a bridge between them. Due to this, the attacker can read, insert, and modify the data in the intercepted connection.

## System-based attacks

These are the attacks intended to compromise a computer or a computer network. Some of the important system-based attacks are as follows:

### 1. Virus

It is a type of malicious software program that spreads throughout computer files without the knowledge of the user. It is a self-replicating malicious computer program that replicates by inserting copies of itself into other computer programs when executed. It can also execute instructions that cause harm to the system.

### 2. Worm

It is a type of malware whose primary function is to replicate itself to spread to uninfected computers. It works similarly to a computer virus. Worms often originate from email attachments that appear to be from trusted senders.

### 3. Trojan Horse

It is a malicious program that causes unexpected changes to computer settings and unusual activity, even when the computer should be idle. It misleads the user about its true intent. It appears to be a normal application, but when opened/executed, some malicious code runs in the background.

### 4. Backdoors

It is a method that bypasses the normal authentication process. A developer may create a backdoor so that an application or operating system can be accessed for troubleshooting or other purposes.

### 5. Bots

A bot (short for "robot") is an automated process that interacts with other network services. Some bot programs run automatically, while others execute commands only when they receive specific input. Common examples of bot programs are web crawlers, chatroom bots, and malicious bots.
